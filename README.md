## Short description
### What's the problem?

Lack of weather foresting Construction and Mining industries used face lot of problems and loss investment on Manpower, Raw materials and sometimes lives due to unexpected events during heavy rainfalls.

### How can technology help?
Technology can help in analysis the feature weather conditions to plan the mining and constructions works accordingly.
### The Idea 
From the past weather history at specific location, we will train the best Machine learning Algorithm to predict the future weather condition, so that we can inform Construction and mining Industries about the weather conditions in upcoming days.
	So that these industries can plan to deploy manpower, arranging Raw materials and necessary safety precautions depends on the weather condition to avoid revenue loss, and worker life losses due to unexpected events.
